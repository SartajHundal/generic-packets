# Packet Processor

Welcome to this Packet Processor project! It is a versatile software component designed to facilitate packet processing, transaction analysis, and exploring a few services in Azure as an alternative to going with pure blockchain-based languages. This component plays a pivotal role within systems requiring transaction management and liquidity analysis. We are replicating a few known results from familiar names on GitHub - they got lost in my CRM, so please forgive me as the documentation undergoes improvements. :) These are long projects, and I do not get paid for this work (and no, this does not make it a hobby project).

## Features

- **Packet Processing**: Efficiently processes incoming packets, incorporating transaction monitoring utilizing the Web3.0 protocol.
- **Azure Blob Storage Integration**: Seamlessly stores processed data in Azure Blob Storage, ensuring reliability and scalability. This is a nice-to-have; we may be able to get away from the bloated microservices like Redis in the current Garnet project.
- **Stablecoin Interoperability**: Facilitates interaction with stablecoins through a provided RPC wrapper, enabling diverse transaction capabilities.
- **Cryptocurrency Utility**: Empowers the discovery and management of new cryptocurrencies, offering flexibility in blockchain integration.

## Getting Started

To begin using the Packet Processor, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Ensure the necessary dependencies are installed, including the Azure.Storage.Blobs package.
2. **Configuration**: Initialize the PacketProcessor class with the connection string and container name.
3. **Usage**: Utilize the provided methods for packet processing, transaction analysis, and data storage.
